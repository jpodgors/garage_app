	Using rails, created new garage web app, rails new garage
	
	A product will contain the following parameters in the db:
		- Title identify product
		- Description
		- Image
		- list_price initial price 
		- minimum price, absolutely the lowest accepted price for this product
		
		list_price and minimum_price are used by the haggler method which provides the
		user with the ability to negotiate a price on a product of interest.
		If list_price and minimum_price are identical, there is no 'wiggle' room left
